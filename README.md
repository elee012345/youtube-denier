I watch way too much youtube lol

so this browser extension detects if I have a youtube tab open and immediately closes it
L to youtube

to use it to to extensions, turn on developer mode, load unpacked and select this folder

the commented out section is another way to do things but I think i'm doing it wrong because no way actual js devs do it that way
i just say js is aids and not that i have a skill issue
